Title: Understanding CI/CD

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are practices in software development aimed at automating and improving the process of delivering software changes.

Continuous Integration (CI):
- Frequently integrates code changes into a shared repository.
- Automatically verifies changes by building and running automated tests.
- Detects integration errors early in the development process.

Continuous Delivery (CD):
- Automates the deployment process to ensure quick and reliable releases.
- Every code change passing CI is automatically deployed to staging.
- Staging environments undergo further testing before manual deployment to production.

Continuous Deployment:
- Extends Continuous Delivery by automatically deploying every validated code change to production.
- Requires a high degree of automation and confidence in the CI/CD pipeline.

Tools commonly used in CI/CD pipelines include Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions.

Benefits of CI/CD:
- Automates repetitive tasks.
- Reduces manual errors.
- Enables rapid and reliable deployments.

Overall, CI/CD practices help development teams deliver high-quality software more efficiently.
