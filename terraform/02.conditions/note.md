```hcl
instance_type = var.instance_name == "Mongodb" ? "t3.micro" : "t2.micro"
```

This line is a conditional expression used to set the `instance_type` attribute based on the value of the `var.instance_name` variable.

### Breakdown of the Expression

- `var.instance_name == "Mongodb"`: This is the condition being evaluated. It checks if the `instance_name` variable is equal to the string `"Mongodb"`.

- `? "t3.micro"`: If the condition is true (i.e., `var.instance_name` is `"Mongodb"`), the `instance_type` will be set to `"t3.micro"`.

- `: "t2.micro"`: If the condition is false (i.e., `var.instance_name` is not `"Mongodb"`), the `instance_type` will be set to `"t2.micro"`.

### Usage in a Resource Block

Hereâ€™s how you might use this conditional expression in a Terraform resource block:

```hcl
variable "instance_name" {
  description = "The name of the instance type"
  type        = string
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = var.instance_name == "Mongodb" ? "t3.micro" : "t2.micro"
  count         = 1

  tags = {
    Name = var.instance_name
  }
}
```
