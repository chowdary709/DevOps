- `var.instance_name`: This refers to a variable named `instance_name` passed to the Terraform module or configuration block where this code is being used.

- `count.index`: `count` is a special variable in Terraform that represents the current iteration index when used inside a resource block with a `count` parameter. `count.index` is the index of the current iteration, starting from 0.

- `var.instance_name[count.index]` essentially retrieves the value of the `instance_name` variable at the current index in the iteration. It's a way to access each element of the `instance_name` list or array as Terraform iterates over it.
